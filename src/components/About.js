            The <a className="pom-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pomodoro technique</a> was invented by Francisco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
            </p>

            <p>
            Each 25-minute interval, known as a Pomodoro, is followed by a short break of around 5 minutes. A long break of 10 to 15 minutes is usually taken after four consecutive Pomodoros.
            </p>

            <p>
            This version of the timer offers a tracking function, which adds up the total time worked. This may be particularly useful for freelancers and those working from home.
